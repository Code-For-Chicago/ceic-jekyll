    related to materials found on this Site. Our copyright agent is Cannabis Equity’s
    General Counsel. The agent can be reached at: info@cannabisequityil.org, or via
    U.S. Mail at 277 Springbrook Trail S. Oswego, IL 60543.</p><p>To be effective,

    is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner
    or that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that

    containing the information as outlined in 1 through 6 above:</p><ol><li><p>Cannabis
    Equity will remove or disable access to the content that is alleged to be infringing;</p></li><li><p>Cannabis
    Equity will forward the written notification to the alleged infringer; and</p></li><li><p>Cannabis
    Equity will take reasonable steps to promptly notify the alleged infringer that
    we have removed or disabled access to the content.</p></li></ol><p><strong>DMCA
    Infringement Counter Notification.</strong></p><p>Pursuant to the DMCA, after
    the alleged infringer receives a notice of infringement from Cannabis Equity,
    the alleged infringer will have the opportunity to respond to Cannabis Equity
    with a counter notification (“Counter Notification”). To be effective, a Counter
    Notification must be a written communication provided to Cannabis Equity’s designated
    copyright agent, and must include the following:</p><ol><li><p>A physical or electronic
    signature of the subscriber;</p></li><li><p>Identification of the material that
    has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which
    the material appeared before it was removed or access disabled;</p></li><li><p>The
    following statement: “I swear under penalty of perjury that it is my good faith
    belief that the material identified above was removed or disabled as a result
    of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled”; and</p></li><li><p>The
    subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber
    consents to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the judicial district
    in which the subscriber address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is
    outside of the United States, or any judicial district in which Cannabis Equity
    may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the
    person who provided notification or an agent of such person.</p></li></ol><p>Upon
    the copyright agent’s receipt of a Counter Notification containing the information
    as outlined in 1 through 4 above, the DMCA provides that the removed material
    will be restored or access re-enabled and we will comply with this requirement
    as required by law, provided that the designated agent has not received notice
    from the original complaining party that an action has been filed seeking a court
    order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating
    to the material on our network.</p>"
