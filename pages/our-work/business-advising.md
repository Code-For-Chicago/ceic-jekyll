  text: In March of 2020, Nature’s Care signed the first-of-its-kind Community Benefits
    Agreement (CBA) with the Cannabis Equity Illinois Coalition (CEIC) and the ColaGroup.  The
    purpose of Nature’s Care agreements with Cannabis Equity Illinois Coalition and
    ColaGroup is to advocate and support disproportionately impacted individuals,
    to reinvest in our communities and to enact positive change. Not only do we believe
    in the beneficial properties of the plant, but we also believe the industry can
    provide the community and state with much economic gain.
