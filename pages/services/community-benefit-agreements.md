description: 'What is a Community Benefit Agreement?  As part of cannabis legalization,
  Illinois lawmakers allowed for the existing medical cannabis dispensary operators
  to open a “Plus-1” recreational dispensary. These existing operators, none of whom
  are led by individuals from impacted communities, are allowed to get a head start
  on expanding their businesses in Illinois, while new entrepreneurs are forced to
  wait.  To ensure that these companies, many of whom are multi-state operators, are
  doing their fair share to support communities impacted by prohibition, we started
  the #CannabisCBA campaign. Alongside Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights,
  we’ve drafted the first Cannabis Community Benefits Agreement in the country.  The
  Country''s First Cannabis CBA  On March 3, 2020, we announced our very first CBA
  with a dispensary! Read about our agreement with Nature’s Care Company in Crain’s
  and Block Club Chicago. We signed our second agreement in the Summer of 2020, and
  hope all “Plus-1” dispensaries will work with organizations like ours to ensure
  most impacted communities are benefiting from these dispensaries.  The most impactful
  community benefits partnerships will result in all of the goals and commitments
  listed below becoming memorialized in a Community Benefits Agreement between the
  new dispensary and the Coalition.  The Future  We have an action plan to bring this
  CBA and negotiate its binding terms with licensed cannabis businesses. We encourage
  you to join us, especially at public meetings for proposed dispensaries in 2020
  — for the most up to date public meetings regarding new sites for cannabis businesses,

  this campaign, so that the “plus-1” dispensaries statewide are working with community
  partners.'

    Agreements (CBAs) are agreements between community members/organizations and businesses,
    designed to ensure local needs are met when new developments come to town. From
    housing developments, museums &amp; casinos, to the cannabis industry, businesses
    have an obligation to listen to the community and include them in their plans.
