  text_area: <h2>What We Believe</h2><p>The Cannabis Equity Illinois Coalition believes
    that if Illinois is going to address the injustices of prohibition, then everyone
    who has a criminal record for a cannabis offense should have their record cleared
    immediately.</p><p>We strongly believe in utilizing technology to support this
    work, and fully support the use of automatic expungement in Illinois. The Coalition
    also supports the transition to E-Filing, so that someone can submit their petition
    for expungement using a computer.</p><p>The Coalition believes in expunging cannabis
    records as widely as possible, especially those that are not ‘Stand-alone’ offenses.</p><h2>What
    We Do</h2><p>The Coalition partners with legal aids organizations across the state
    to support record clearing, with greater emphasis in Chicagoland. You can also
    utilize online support through our partners here:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.cgla.net/get-legal-help">Cabrini-Green

    Lawndale, where community members were able to learn about the expungement process
    and connect with an expungement attorney, FOR FREE!</p><p>Despite the COVID-19
    pandemic the Coalition successfully hosted more events for National Expungement
