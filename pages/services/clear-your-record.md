  text_area: "<h2>What We Believe</h2><p>The Cannabis Equity Illinois Coalition believes
    that if Illinois is going to address the injustices of prohibition, then everyone
    who has a criminal record for a cannabis offense should have their record cleared
    immediately.</p><p>We strongly believe in utilizing technology to support this
    work, and fully support the use of automatic expungement in Illinois. The Coalition
    also supports the transition to E-Filing, so that someone can submit their petition
    for expungement using a computer.</p><p>The Coalition believes in expunging cannabis
    records as widely as possible, especially those that are not ‘Stand-alone’ offenses.</p>"
  column_two: "<h2>What We Do</h2><p>The Coalition organizes record clearing events
    every other month in Chicago, along with quarterly community reentry resources
    fairs events to support our neighbors come home. Our programming is available
    to all people, not just those who have cannabis records.</p><p>We also provide
    connections and resources for people outside of Chicagoland, and partner with
    organizations across the state to host events.</p><p>If you are in need of expungement
    support, would like to partner with us for an event, please reach out to the Coalition
    at CannabisEquityIL@gmail.com.</p>"
