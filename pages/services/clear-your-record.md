  text_area: "<h2>What We Believe</h2><p>The Cannabis Equity Illinois Coalition believes
    that if Illinois is going to address the injustices of prohibition, then everyone
    who has a criminal record for a cannabis offense should have their record cleared
    immediately.</p><p>We strongly believe in utilizing technology to support this
    work, and fully support the use of automatic expungement in Illinois. The Coalition
    also supports the transition to E-Filing, so that someone can submit their petition
    for expungement using a computer.</p><p>The Coalition believes in expunging cannabis
    records as widely as possible, especially those that are not ‘Stand-alone’ offenses.</p>"
  column_two: <h2>What We Do</h2><p>The Coalition organizes events quarterly in Chicago,
    along with annual events for <a href="https://nationalexpungementweek.org/">National
    Expungement Week</a>. We hope to expand our impact outside of Chicagoland, and
    to partner with organizations across the state to host events. Please reach out
    if your organization in interested in partnering!</p><p>The Coalition got involved
    in National Expungement Week in 2019, having been introduced to NEW through our
    partners in Boston, the <a href="https://massreccouncil.com/">Massachusetts Recreational
    Consumer Council</a>. The Coalition hosted events in Back of the Yards and North
    Lawndale, where community members were able to learn about the expungement process
    and connect with an expungement attorney, FOR FREE!</p>
