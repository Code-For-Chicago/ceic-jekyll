description: A Community Benefits Agreement is a tool community members can use to
  ensure local developments provide benefits to their community. These benefits could
  include commitments to hire local workers or to address concerns related to the
  developments’ impact on the community. It is a flexible tool that can be adapted
  to reflect each community’s concerns and priorities.

  text_area: '<h2>What is a Community Benefit Agreement?</h2><p>As part of cannabis
    legalization, Illinois lawmakers allowed for the existing medical cannabis dispensary
    operators to open a “Plus-1” recreational dispensary. These existing operators,
    none of whom are led by individuals from impacted communities, are allowed to
    get a head start on expanding their businesses in Illinois, while new entrepreneurs
    are forced to wait.</p><p>To ensure that these companies, many of whom are multi-state
    operators, are doing their fair share to support communities impacted by prohibition,
    we started the #CannabisCBA campaign. Alongside <a href="https://www.clccrul.org/">Chicago
    Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights</a>, we’ve drafted the first Cannabis Community
    Benefits Agreement in the country.</p><h2>The Country''s First Cannabis CBA</h2><p>On
    March 3, 2020, we <a href="https://mailchi.mp/clccrul/cannabis-equity-coalition-natures-care-cba">announced</a>
    our very first CBA with a dispensary! Read about our agreement with Nature’s Care
    Company in <a href="https://github.com/Code-For-Chicago/cecil_website/raw/master/src/images/Crains_cba.pdf">Crain’s</a>
    and <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/03/06/weed-company-vows-to-hire-those-hurt-by-war-on-drugs-and-more-in-milestone-agreement-with-cannabis-equity-coalition/">Block
    Club Chicago</a>. We signed our second agreement in the Summer of 2020, and hope
    all “Plus-1” dispensaries will work with organizations like ours to ensure most
    impacted communities are benefiting from these dispensaries.</p><p>The most impactful
    community benefits partnerships will result in all of the goals and commitments
    listed below becoming memorialized in a Community Benefits Agreement between the
    new dispensary and the Coalition.</p><h2>The Future</h2><p>We have an action plan
    to bring this CBA and negotiate its binding terms with licensed cannabis businesses.
    We encourage you to join us, especially at public meetings for proposed dispensaries
    in 2020 — for the most up to date public meetings regarding new sites for cannabis
    businesses, DM or follow us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CannaEquityIL">@CannaEquityIL</a>.
    We welcome everyone across the state to engage with this campaign, so that the
    “plus-1” dispensaries statewide are working with community partners.</p><p></p>'
