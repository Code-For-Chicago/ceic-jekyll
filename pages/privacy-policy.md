  text_area: "<h2><strong>1. What Information Is Collected</strong></h2><p>The following
    are the types of information we may collect:</p><p>We may collect personal information
    like name, telephone number, email address, home or business mailing address,
    and account information, when you access certain areas of the Website, or if you
    require more information about those services. For certain aspects of our services,
    we may require login information such as username and password, secret answers
    to certain security questions, or other similar information that allows us to
    uniquely identify your account or authenticate you prior to giving you access
    to your account information or certain online activities. We may capture certain
    information automatically on our Website (even if you do not voluntarily provide
    us with Personal Information, or in addition to any Personal Information that
    you do provide), including your Internet protocol address, Internet service provider,
    browser type, and linking information. Typically, this information is for us to
    develop aggregated Website server statistics (how many people access our Website
    and what pages are they interested in). At times, our systems may make this information
    identifiable to you, and, if so, it will be treated and protected as Personal
    Information.</p><p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong></p><p>At other times,
    we may collect information that cannot be used to directly identify you, such
    as browser type, Dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) address, “click stream” data,
    and similar non-personally identifiable information. For example, we may aggregate
    non-personal information about you and other customers who visit certain areas
    of our Website. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can
    be linked directly back to you.</p><p>While we take all reasonable steps to protect
    the privacy of our Website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations
    of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor
    every personal browser preference. In particular, we have not implemented the
    necessary program changes to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. As
    our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps
    to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this privacy policy for
    further updates on this topic.</p><p>Further, our online service providers or
    business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of
    personally identifiable information over time and across websites. We recommend
    that you review each privacy policy posted on the websites that you visit to better
    understand privacy practices on those websites.</p><p><br></p>"
