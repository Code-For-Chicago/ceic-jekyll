    following are the types of information we may collect:</p><p><br></p><p>We may
    collect personal information like name, telephone number, email address, home
    or business mailing address, and account information, when you access certain
    areas of the Website, or if you require more information about those services.
    For certain aspects of our services, we may require login information such as
    username and password, secret answers to certain security questions, or other
    similar information that allows us to uniquely identify your account or authenticate
    you prior to giving you access to your account information or certain online activities.
    We may capture certain information automatically on our Website (even if you do
    not voluntarily provide us with Personal Information, or in addition to any Personal
    Information that you do provide), including your Internet protocol address, Internet
    service provider, browser type, and linking information. Typically, this information
    is for us to develop aggregated Website server statistics (how many people access
    our Website and what pages are they interested in). At times, our systems may
    make this information identifiable to you, and, if so, it will be treated and
    protected as Personal Information.</p><p>Non-Personal Information</p><p>At other
    times, we may collect information that cannot be used to directly identify you,
    such as browser type, Dynamic Internet Protocol (IP) address, “click stream” data,
    and similar non-personally identifiable information. For example, we may aggregate
    non-personal information about you and other customers who visit certain areas
    of our Website. Aggregated information will not contain any information that can
    be linked directly back to you.</p><p>While we take all reasonable steps to protect
    the privacy of our Website visitors, we cannot promise that the current limitations
    of our online applications programming will address every browser setting or honor
    every personal browser preference. In particular, we have not implemented the
    necessary program changes to honor “Do Not Track” or “DNT” browser signals. As
    our online applications programming is refined, we will take all reasonable steps
    to honor such requests in the future. Please return to this privacy policy for
    further updates on this topic.</p><p>Further, our online service providers or
    business partners may implement technologies that allow for the collection of
    personally identifiable information over time and across websites. We recommend
    that you review each privacy policy posted on the websites that you visit to better
    understand privacy practices on those websites.</p><p><strong>2. How Do We Collect

    areas on the Website, including, without limitation, those described below:</p><p>Subscribing

    logs, and may be available for extended periods of time.</p><p>Transaction Information</p><p>If
    you conduct a financial or other transaction with the Website we may direct you
    to a third party vendor Website to collect this information from you directly.
    Even though the collection form may have the look and feel of the Website, please
    be aware you will be giving your information directly to the third party vendor,
    and that in some instances such third party vendor''s privacy policy will govern
    the collection of your personal information. Please reference the privacy policies

    vendors will use this information to complete the financial or other transaction

    your personal information to contact you via mail, email, or telephone in order
    to give you updates about our special events, new services, that may be of interest
    to you. We also use return email addresses to answer the e-mail we receive from
    you. We may also use your IP address to help protect us and our Internet Service

    information will allow us to tailor services specific to your needs, to help organize
    and manage your customer relationship and our business, to conduct business, to
    provide you with customer and member support, to perform functions that are described

    use the services of independent companies to provide certain services to you,
    including, without limitation, Website hosting services, and Internet connectivity
    services (“Internet Service Providers”).</p><p>We may also use non-personal aggregate
    information to improve our Website. For example, our Internet Service Providers
    may report to us that there were a particular number of visitors to a certain
    area of our Website, or that a certain number of men or a certain number of women
    completed our registration form in particular areas of our Website. Such information
    may also be used to analyze the effectiveness of our business and advertising
    models.</p><p><strong>4. Shared Information</strong></p><p>We may share your personal
    information with the Internet Service Providers as appropriate. We may also share
    personally identifiable information with outside, non-affiliated third parties
    that offer products and services that are complementary to our product lines.

    advertiser to serve the advertisements on the Website or may use a traffic measurement
    service to analyze the traffic on the Website. Network advertisers are third parties

    to you for products or Websites you might be interested in. Audience and Traffic
    Measurement Services allow us to collect anonymous traffic and behavior information
    from the Website by monitoring anonymous visitor activity. Although advertisers
    or other companies do not have access to the Website cookies, the Website''s advertisers,
