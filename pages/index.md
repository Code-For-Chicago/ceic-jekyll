  text_area: <h2>What We Do</h2><p>Formed in 2019, the Coalition provides a space
    for community members to come together to share their experiences, and to organize
    and advocate to fight for cannabis equity and justice. The Coalition supports
    individuals and communities in the following ways:<br><br>Provides services and
    support for individuals to expunge or seal their criminal records, especially
    for cannabis offenses. We advocate to promote the expansion of automatic expungement,
    and to ensure anyone with a criminal record is able to access record clearing
    in a timely manner.<br><br>We host Know Your Rights education sessions and promote
    KYR information to ensure nobody else is criminalized for cannabis.</p><p>Advocate
    for cannabis dispensaries to formally partner with community organizations by
    encouraging the implementation of Community Benefits Agreements. These agreements
    ensure that new dispensaries directly support disproportionately impacted communities.<br><br>Using
    legislative education to increase engagement amongst our community members in
    the policy process.<br><br>We are the watchdog of the government and of the industry,
    working to ensure legalization benefits those most impacted by cannabis prohibition.</p><p>We
    meet every Thursday at 6PM Central Time on Zoom. Please reach out to the Coalition
    on email to get the link.<br><br>We are in the midst of our expungement programming!
    Check us out on @CannaEquityIL on Facebook, Instagram, &amp; Twitter for more
    information about our events!</p><h2>Get Involved!</h2><p class="column-one">We
    welcome anyone who believes in our mission to get involved with us.<br><br>If
    you would like to support record clearing, you can get involved in organizing
    events and opportunities for expungement, assist people through the expungement
    process, or help promote education on record clearing!<br><br>If youâ€™re a creative,
    we encourage you to engage with the programming of the Coalition, and use your
    skills to promote this work, present these programs to the public through graphic
    design, video, etc., and to help curate content for our social media!<br><br>We
    are organizing events like National Expungement Week, Know Your Rights, and resource
    fairs. We need to support to ensure those events are effective, safe, and impactful
    for all involved!</p><h2>Donate</h2><p class="column-two">The Coalition recently

    impact towards equity and justice.<br><br>To help The Coalition expand our programming,
