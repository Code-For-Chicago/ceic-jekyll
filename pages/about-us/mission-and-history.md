# Mission

Founded in 2019, the Cannabis Equity Illinois Coalition is a grassroots nonprofit that advances equity in the State of Illinois by elevating community voices and collaborating with partners to create change in the cannabis industry. We fight to make sure the legalization of cannabis in Illinois repairs and reinvests in the communities most impacted by the War on Drugs, and to ensure the cannabis industry prioritizes people over profits.

# Values

The Coalition utilizes its grassroots strength to advocate for ‘Plus-1’ dispensaries to sign onto a Community Benefits Agreements, tying the economic success of those dispensaries to impacted communities.

The Coalition's grassroots structure shapes the development of the Coalition's legislative priorities, as we gather community feedback to ensure we're fighting for changes that will bring the largest benefit to communities.

The Coalition organizes to expand record clearing opportunities in Chicagoland and across Illinois, and educates communities about their rights and record clearing opportunities.
