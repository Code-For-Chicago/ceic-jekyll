      of Chicago by Ilinois legislators, community members demanded accountability
      and transparency in the legalization law. This leads to the first Coalition
      meeting at the Port Ministries in Back of the Yards where the group develops
      a list of priorities for legalized cannabis. During the Coalition’s first year,
      they met with lawmakers to share their strategies to achieve equity & justice,
      participated in National Expungement Week events, and launched the Know Your
      Rights program.
