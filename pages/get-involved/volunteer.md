  text_area: <h2>Event Organizers</h2><p class="column-description">Are you interested
    in organizing events like record clearing days or resource fairs? We host them
    regularly in different areas of the city, and welcome volunteers and community
    partners to host these events.</p><h2>Fundraisers</h2><p>Have ideas about fundraising
    campaigns or other ways to generate revenue? We welcome all support exploring
    fundraising strategies!</p><h2>Policy Shapers</h2><p class="column-description">Interested
    in shaping policy at the local and state level?<br>We are always looking for people
    to think of innovative policies to support communities, to create and analyze
    policies, and to connect directly with our elected officials in advocating for
    policy change!</p><h2>Creatives</h2><p class="column-description">Are you interested
    in taking photos or videos of movement work? Do you like graphic design? We encourage
    you to engage with the Coalition, and use our skills to promote our work, present
    these programs to the public, and more to expand access to our work!</p><h2>Educators</h2><p>You
    know your community best. We welcome anyone interested in expanding education
    to join our work. You could educate people about legal rights, and how they have
    been impacted by legal cannabis, as well as political education. This is critical
    work, and relies on community trust. If this sounds like something you'd like
    to help out with, hit us up!</p><h2>Donations</h2><p>Because of the federal status
    of cannabis, even though we do not touch the plant at all, there is limited access
    to funding for this work.</p><p><br>Most of our members are currently volunteers,
    and we hope to eventually pay staff for this work full time! Donations help us
    continue this work by paying staff, and to help us access necessary resources
    to continue this work. We are organising events like National Expungement Week,
    Know Your Rights, and resource fairs. Those events are incredibly important, but
    arenâ€™t free! We hope to one day open up a physical office, that can be a resource
    center for the community.</p>
