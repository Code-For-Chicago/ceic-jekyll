    you would like to support record clearing, you can get involved in organizing
    events and opportunities for expungement, assist people through the expungement
    process, or help promote education on record clearing!</p><h3 class="column-heading">Policy
    Shapers</h3><p class="column-description">Interested in shaping policy at the
    local and state level?<br>We are always looking for people to think of innovative
    policies to support communities, to create and analyze policies, and to connect
    directly with our elected officials in advocating for policy change!</p><h3 class="column-heading">Creatives</h3><p
    class="column-description">Are you creative?<br>We encourage you to engage with
    the programming of the Coalition, and use your skills to promote this work, present
    these programs to the public through graphic design, video, etc., and to help
    curate content for our social media!</p><h2>Educators</h2><p>You know your community
    best. We welcome anyone that would like to get involved in helping educate people
    about their rights, and how they have been impacted by legal cannabis. This is
    critical work, and relies on community trust. If this sounds like something you'd
    like to help out with, hit us up!</p><h2>Donations</h2><p>Because of the federal
    status of cannabis, even though we do not touch the plant at all, there is limited
    access to funding for this work.<br><br>All of our members are currently volunteers,
    and we hope to eventually pay staff for this work full time!<br><br>Donations
    help us continue this work by paying staff, and to help us access necessary resources
    to continue this work.<br><br>We are organising events like National Expungement
    Week, Know Your Rights, and resource fairs. Those events are incredibly important,
    but arenâ€™t free!<br><br>We hope to one day open up a physical office, that can
    be a resource center for the community.</p>
