  text_area: '<h2>What is a Community Benefit Agreement?</h2><p>As part of cannabis
    legalization, Illinois lawmakers allowed for the existing medical cannabis dispensary
    operators to open a “Plus-1” recreational dispensary. These existing operators,
    none of whom are led by individuals from impacted communities, are allowed to
    get a head start on expanding their businesses in Illinois, while new entrepreneurs
    are forced to wait.</p><p>To ensure that these companies, many of whom are multi-state
    operators, are doing their fair share to support communities impacted by prohibition,
    we started the #CannabisCBA campaign. Alongside <a href="https://www.clccrul.org/"
    target="_blank">Chicago Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights</a>, we’ve drafted
    the first Cannabis Community Benefits Agreement in the country.</p><h2>The Country''s
    First Cannabis CBA</h2><p>On March 3, 2020, we <a href="https://mailchi.mp/clccrul/cannabis-equity-coalition-natures-care-cba"
    target="_blank">announced</a> our very first CBA with a dispensary! Read about
    our agreement with Nature’s Care Company in <a href="https://github.com/Code-For-Chicago/cecil_website/raw/master/src/images/Crains_cba.pdf"
    target="_blank">Crain’s</a> and <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2020/03/06/weed-company-vows-to-hire-those-hurt-by-war-on-drugs-and-more-in-milestone-agreement-with-cannabis-equity-coalition/"
    target="_blank">Block Club Chicago</a>. We signed our second agreement in the
    Summer of 2020, and hope all “Plus-1” dispensaries will work with organizations
    like ours to ensure most impacted communities are benefiting from these dispensaries.</p><p>The
    most impactful community benefits partnerships will result in all of the goals
    and commitments listed below becoming memorialized in a Community Benefits Agreement
    between the new dispensary and the Coalition.</p><h2>The Future</h2><p>We have
    an action plan to bring this CBA and negotiate its binding terms with licensed
    cannabis businesses. We encourage you to join us, especially at public meetings
    for proposed dispensaries in 2020 — for the most up to date public meetings regarding
    new sites for cannabis businesses, DM or follow us <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CannaEquityIL"
    target="_blank">@CannaEquityIL</a>. We welcome everyone across the state to engage
    with this campaign, so that the “plus-1” dispensaries statewide are working with
    community partners.</p>'
